# Integritul [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ul1x7ajaj573gefn/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tulpep/integritul/branch/master)
Tool that allows you to check the integrity of an unity or folder and identify the changes made to its content. 

First, you can choose any folder to generate a very very small .integritul file that contains the status of every file inside the folder you choose, it recursively obtains the status of all items in every folder inside the selected one. This file has the advantage of being very small, even for very large folders. 

Then, you compare your folder or unity with the generated .integritul file and Integritul will show you the differences between the saved and current folder status. It will show which files have been deleted, added or modified and their respective path.
