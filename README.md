# Integritul [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ul1x7ajaj573gefn/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tulpep/integritul/branch/master)
Tool that allows you to check the integrity of an unity or folder and identify the changes made to its content. 

First, you can choose any folder to generate a very small .integritul file that contains the status of every item in the folder you choose. Integritul recursively obtains the status of all items in every folder inside the one you choose. 

Then, you compare your folder or unity with the generated .integritul file and Integritul will show you the differences between the saved and current folder status.
